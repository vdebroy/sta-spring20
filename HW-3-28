Q1. In our session, we refactored slightly to handle the case when denominator is zero in just one place. But there is still a lot of code duplication.

Can you reduce the duplication for this pattern:

       if(b == 0){
         return getResultWhenDenominatorIsZero();
       }
        if(a < b){
            return 0;
       }

while not breaking correctness of your program.

Q2. What we did in IncrementExamples.java - I want you to practice with decrement.

Create a new file called DecrementExamples.java, upload it and test it with some different numbers. For example, set i to various things and run and observe the output.
