Q1. In our session, we refactored slightly to handle the case when denominator is zero in just one place. But there is still a lot of code duplication.

Can you reduce the duplication for this pattern:

       if(b == 0){
         return getResultWhenDenominatorIsZero();
       }
        if(a < b){
            return 0;
       }

while not breaking correctness of your program.
